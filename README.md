I'm a Telematics Engineer and work as a software developer, currently living
from Python, JS and Odoo.

Some of my favorite things to do in my free time are:

- Read eBooks (Harry Potter and The Prisoner of Azkaban now)
- Take care of my precious cherry tomatoes.
- Trying to teach my cats to use a leash
- Learn to create scripts with bash to make my life easier
- Watch movies, of course.
- Discover new places to eat in my hometown
